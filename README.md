Hey Bunny Studio this is my test for the problem that you send to me

I've use SpringBoot as Microservices and Vuejs for front end, also I've use postgres sql for database

Springboot is with a repository pattern and the front end is developed with vue-cli

For running this app you would have to clone the repository and make the following steps

For Spring project

1) Clone or download the project
2) Install Dependencies with Maven (mvn clean install)
3) Import project to IDE
4) Run the project

mvn spring-boot:run

Note : Inside the project in the application.properties file, the properties:
```
spring.jpa.generate-ddl = true
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create-drop
Automatically the database is going to be creating with the following connection param:
```
For Vue project

1) Go inside client folder
2) npm install
3) npm run dev
