Hey Bunny Studio this is my test for the problem that you send to me

I've use SpringBoot as Microservices and Vuejs for front end, also I've use postgres sql for database

Springboot is with a repository pattern and the front end is developed with vue-cli

For running this app you would have to clone the repository and make the following steps

For Spring project

1) complete the setup con the application.properties specifying username, password and datasource url
2) mvc clean install
3) ./mvnw spring-boot:run

For Vue project

1) Go inside client folder
2) npm install
3) npm run dev
